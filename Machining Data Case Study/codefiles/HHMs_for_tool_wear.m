%% Hidden Markov Models for RUL Prognosis
% Attempt to use HHMs to predict health state sequence given a "prior" pdf
% developed from the data acquired

%% Modelling the tool wear process
% Assume the tool wear can be represented by a Markov chain

%% Formulation
% Ak is the transition probability matrix for the k-step HMM
% Equation 1 defines the probability transition matrix
